Bugzilla is a robust, featureful and mature defect-tracking system, or
bug-tracking system. Defect-tracking systems allow teams of developers to keep
track of outstanding bugs, problems, issues, enhancement and other change
requests in their products effectively. Simple defect-tracking capabilities are
often built into integrated source code management environments such as Github
or other web-based or locally-installed equivalents. We find organizations
turning to Bugzilla when they outgrow the capabilities of those systems - for
example, because they want workflow management, or bug visibility control
(security), or custom fields.

Bugzilla is both free as in freedom and free as in price. Most commercial
defect-tracking software vendors charge enormous licensing fees. Despite being
free, Bugzilla has many features which are lacking in both its expensive and
its free counterparts. Consequently, Bugzilla is used by hundreds or thousands
of organizations across the globe.

Bugzilla is a web-based system but needs to be installed on your server for you
to use it. However, installation is not complex.
